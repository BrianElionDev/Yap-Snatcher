I Don't know if you can tell but before this that was acting I was doing an impression of everybody in this industry right now Which is apparently full of blue whale size colossal put mother you on the toilet right now pissing blood Vinegar and fear dick fully inverted in terror. You should be buying right now urgently abruptly now But with a colossal boner because the prices that you're seeing right now You are not going to get a shot at for long Especially the coins the alts the industries I talked about in this video from these points from this max fear from these Revealing prices we are going to see biblical gains because as I stated last few I have not been this horny about the markets This erect since November 2023, which is smart because in this video You're going to see why these prices are insane the reasons why we're still probably likely to have a bullish year and the exact coins Industries and dirty little Ponzi schemes. I think you're gonna attend 20 and 30 extra which let's get one thing straight This is going to piss a lot of people off All I see on crypto Twitter right now is endless crying Rage an angry twisting of one's nipples at the price is different that we're seeing right now Which frankly is putting us in a dark place with Trump being president now his decision to ban all the tampons from the girls Bathroom. I don't know about this. I think it's a bad decision because if we have another crypto event We have another huge gathering We are going to need every single men's room stuff to the brim of tampon because apparently this industry has become full of giant What is wrong with you people? These are the times you are looking for How exactly do you expect to make giant storybook gains in crypto? You think it comes from buying when everybody's patting you on the back and screaming to get in and your uber drivers telling you about Their latest meme coin investment. No, you fucking retard you buy when everyone is calling you a fucking retard Look, I know you're here. I know you're a big fan I know you've been watching me for years and just salivating at the drop of my next video So I don't need to remind you that in November 2023 the time when we made all of our biggest gains and buys that are still significantly up to right now Everyone was calling us retard. Oh, don't buy here. It'll go lower Oh, it's too risky to buy here. Don't possibly be bullish or buy coins after 80% drawdown. That makes no sense That's what the same motherfuckers who are investing their life savings in Libra and the meme coin super cycle That's what they were yelling at us back then because the market looked dangerous. It looked like shit It looked like but those are the buy points where we got the 10 20 and even a few 30 X's That's what we make money yet And now the time has arrived once again any bullish sentiment right now any talk of buying any mentioning that the prices Should look good. Now that they're 80% lower is resulting in mass rage and people calling us retard which is Exactly when the alpha poppy K will the most woke the most family-friendly in PG most famous crypto advice guy on the entire Internet maybe in all of finance that is when I like to buy so without further ado Let's talk about this because intros aside Everyone's gonna hate me for saying this Everybody's gonna poop on me if this video is wrong people are gonna use it for the next decade to call me an idiot and That's fine because eight out of ten times me being a bullish asshole in situations like this This is where I've made all my money And so what I want to do in this video is a stop talking in a raspy voice like macho man It hurts my throat, but I have to get you five-year-old ADHD motherfuckers attention somehow Look, we're gonna talk about what is happening the market right now and the big question you have Is this the bottom is there any chance we possibly bowl from here? And what I'm gonna lay out to you is why I am extremely bullish right now Why I recently bought millions and millions of dollars worth of crypto and I'm gonna lay out a scenario to you that most people Are not seeing right now where we actually make a ton of money now We'll not only lay out the scenario to you I will literally go and give you the treasure map the Chili's coloring book version of the industries coins and projects I think are gonna see crazy gains from here So let's begin by the way If you want updates and everything a lot faster You want to see what I'm thinking immediately follow me on Twitter at CSS Becker That's also where I'm releasing all the info on my meme coin Don't focus on that right now because what I'm about to lay out right here is much more important also guys when I enter a video for just a little glasses off non WWF character look people's egos and Emotions are very fragile right now. I'm not gonna make one of these every video, but I'm gonna make it this video look in this video I'm a little bit intense because I'm pumped up about the market. I'm excited I'm also throwing a little bit of zesty spin on it Please don't take my intensity as making fun of you or trying to make you feel bad for being down or making bad calls Trying to make you feel stupid trying to insult you just pumped up. I'm amped to WWF character on top of that throughout this video I'm really bullish right now, but I got to emphasize read the disclaimer below this video read this clamored I post in every video. This is super duper crazy risky. This is a huge gamble. I'm gambling right here I don't want anybody to feel like super pressured or like you have to inject your life savings My big suggestion to you is like don't touch this at all or buy the big chunky huge coins Don't get into the dirty little micro caps cryptos disgusting degenerate game So I'm not gonna put one of these in every video But people's egos and emotions are just all over the place right here So I have to give like a good like Here's a Xanax chill out people are like two Zen packs and a Red Bull away from lighting their houses on fire Which is really the best time to buy but I don't want to push anyone over the edge here So, please take the entertainment value this video. Don't feel pressure to do anything stupid Let's get back into before I get super bullish on you before I actually tell you why you're probably still gonna make money and you Shouldn't sell your coins right now. In fact, you should probably be buying every single video for the last six months I have told you you're going to lose your money I have told you there's going to be points in the market where is scary as shit and scares everybody out of the market the reason why bear traps the reason why bullish dumps the reason why Crypto is hard is because the dumps and the panic it causes is very scary and it convinces a lot of people to leave the Market, in fact the market really starts going up until most people are super bearish and out of the market I don't know if you've noticed but the past three months people will literally throw hundreds of millions of dollars at random ass meme coins That pop up without any resistance whatsoever. People have not just been bullish They've been drunk out of their fucking minds and it's really taken a huge Cosmic 20-foot dick across the face to wake people up and now everybody is all shocked and calling the cycle over now Everybody's saying oh wait It can go lower here when they were super bullish at $280 Solana and now that we're down to $140 They're saying don't buy now Don't buy after an 80% drawdown now did a lot of mid caps and lower caps are down 80 70 60 percent people say don't buy here Don't buy here wait, and I just have to take a step back because on this channel I'm never gonna act like I'm the world's greatest road My literal main is I try to buy when prices are just dumpster on fire And then I just hold for years until it works out, which is exactly what we're still doing here There was never going to be a time Were you able to get to your fucking sell prices without feeling some form of substantial fear and the market has not felt any Fear for almost six eight months the market has been so bold You can release a coin named fart Bukkake and everybody throws their money all into it and this shit We're seeing right now is why I constantly release videos talking about what the bear markets gonna be like and taking profits and selling and Reminding you lo and behold you're probably gonna get extra bearish and pissed off and angry when you should be fucking by the sentiment I see right now is being ridiculous It's outlandish because people have been so damn offsides in meme coins and trading something They don't really understand and now the same fucking recharge We thought they were experts at the top right here recently in meme coins They're the same people still think they're experts telling you to stay on the market right now serious note I'm remind you there was never an instance There was never some reality were you able to get to our best sell price without you wanting to shit pants a few times So, please I'm not trying to be a dick here I'm not trying to make people feel bad But you're gonna have to understand where I'm coming from when I can't take any of this seriously right now Like what do you what do you think? What what do you think crypto was like? Did you think this would be fun? I told you it wasn't gonna be fun in order to get to where we want and our max sell prices We are going to have to hold through extreme volatility. So let's talk about this volatility. Let's actually talk about the market So obviously the big question on everybody's mind right now is the cycle over is the bull market over? So look I need to break down how crypto works to you guys Once again, there is never such thing as certainty in crypto the way you should picture this entire marketplace is a roulette table and odds Now what we're seeing right now, I'm very bullish on but I'm not bullish because I have absolute certainty I'm bullish because of these prices right here We can get 10 20 X 30 X returns in some of these coins very very easily if we bull again now Imagine you're in Vegas right now And there's a roulette table and you go and you have your choice between red and black 50-50 odds now in Vegas if you win you double your money if you lose you lose your money now imagine if you went to Vegas and odds were this if you win you 20 X your money if you lose you lose half of Your money, which is realistically probably what we're gonna see from now if you ape in those odds are fucking phenomenal You should take that bet every single day of the week if you're younger of access to any excessive capital one I'm not telling anybody to buy right here. Please read the disclaimer right here. Read the disclaimer below the video crypto is suicide I've been telling you guys this and that it's not something that you should be around with You shouldn't be dabbling in mid caps and all caps and low caps and things on this videos if you don't know what you're doing Or you don't have money to lose. So please keep that in mind I don't think you should touch this at all. This video is for the general gamblers who cannot help themselves That is what we're doing right here That's why I'm describing this as a bet but we're looking at this as a is at the bottom Will I make money from here the odds I would say are 50-50 that we bowl that we don't bowl But if we do bowl, we're gonna make 20 X returns right and if we lose here, we're gonna lose half our money That's an insane bet. I'll take that every single day of the week. That's why I haven't sold barely any of my bags That's why I'm still holding right here Now what people are looking for and why people are saying this cycle is over or you were wrong about these coins or whatnot It's so stupid Because if you go and look at let's just say look at B&B right here And I made a post on Twitter the other day showing some other person's trade Showing very similar to right here If we go look at B&B before its giant run up right here and even during its run up We can actually see the same exit thing. We go look at B&B right here. Look at this chart look at this chart brother, how many times did you have to hold from a top down to a 60-70% drawdown one Took another huge dump right here. Literally got cut in half again 50% drawdown 70% drawdown another one right here. And then we went to the top right there. So what people seem to be forgetting and Frankly if you can tell them my tone this video, I'm not annoyed I'm just like what did you guys think crypto was like in order to get these types of gains in crypto? You're going to have to hold through this stuff right here unless you're swing trading this right here Which almost no one watching this video including me is capable of unless you're some pro trader Who can call the tops and bottoms of this right here, which I cannot you're not gonna make money off these coins You're not gonna see these type of gains unless you hold through like this and I want to point out to you How ridiculous would it be if you're looking at this coin right here and say that we get to this dump right here I believe this is that's not even the Copa temp. Here's the here's the Copa dump right here Imagine if you were saying that B&B was a stupid coin to buy right here or right here or right here or right here anywhere On this chart line right here based on the prices on these dumps right here Imagine calling this trade or this bet a bad trade and the truth is right here Well, I'm not guaranteeing results or I'm not guaranteeing some automatic gains right here You have to let your bet play out in crypto. You can't call trades here or here or here or here You can't really call them until your thesis is completely blown out whether it ended up good or bad and frankly right now in crypto The roulette wheel is still spinning people are calling the cycle over people are saying you can't buy coins anymore I don't understand why the sentiment in the world right now in crypto is better than it's ever been Institutions are insanely bullish giving Bitcoin this foundation this rock-solid foundation that we've never seen before in crypto Institutions are buying ETH in wild amounts while also simultaneously suppressing the price You can literally see it all in shame and people are calling the bets in the cycle over people are saying Oh, you can't hold these coins anymore. You need to sell all of them or not buy coins We're not an 80% drawdown. This is why people lose money here because they see volatility Which is the default thing you're gonna see in mid cap and alt coins and low cap coins on this channel We don't really make money trading Bitcoin or a theorem. We make money trading the high-risk volatile coins newsflash This is how they move. So saying oh my coins are 80% 60% down. Therefore the cycles over Therefore I'm not gonna make money on them That's like taking a hot babe on a date a smoking hot 10 and then saying oh I don't think she likes me because her mood swing is changing every five minutes newsflash motherfuck. That's how hot babes at That's how attractive women behave and if you can't deal with a little bit of emotional turbulence You're not gonna fuck if you want some coin It's gonna do this for you You're gonna have to hold to the volatility if you want destra to give you that billion-dollar market cap Did so many of you were searching for you're going to have to hold through the waves for better or worse So I know what you're thinking now. Well are the waves coming back? Are we gonna go up and down again? So now let's address the elephant in the room. Are we gonna go up from here? I don't know 5050 the reason I'm still in and very bullish is the rewards from these points are extremely lopsided Destra has a very solid chance of going to a dollar here. That's a 10x on a good chunky quality coin You're not gonna get entries like that very often people were looking for entries on Destra and similar like coins at 30 cents Now you have perfect entries that are getting close to bear market entry levels and people like I'm not gonna take that I'm gonna wait for lower. Okay, fine But I think that's goofy because our entire thesis the entire thesis on this channel. I post a lot of shit on Twitter I post a lot of things because I think it's funny But if you want to quote me you want to take anything home You want to say this is what this Becker asshole actually thinks the thesis on this channel since November Was wait for Bitcoin to confirm a bull run and so November 2023 when Bitcoin got this price right here I said Bitcoin looks like it's in a bull run It's time to buy altcoins and if you want to buy altcoins our primary coins being AI coins Gaming coins and now RWA coins if you went and bought these coins right here around this point right here You got the absolute lows and you made a shit ton of money and the thesis since this point has been one thing Wait till aetherium busts its all-time high because that is when altcoins are truly going to see their giant gains That is when we're gonna make a whole lot of money There is absolutely almost no logic to selling before ETH has not made these gains Now the bet is exactly that if ETH does not see a new all-time high or ETH does not bust its all-time high and go Higher than that we are fucked. This bet is not going to pay We got up a whole lot and we're gonna lose all of it That is the nature of the fucking bet and the bet was taken with expectations of this type of utility Now I'm using tau right here because I think it's probably gonna be one of the best coins but also because it just Represents overall the market caps of the coins that we're investing in on this channel if ETH doesn't go on break its all-time high We're not going to see gains on this and while I did take a good chunk of profits in the last few months I'm still holding the vast majority of my coins because the bet is that we need to see that aetherium all-time high Now the question is will we see it? Is this thesis going to play out? That's what this entire bet revolves around with aetherium right now If we go look at this coin and we go look at what I think is about to happen here Which is probably the biggest utility alt season we've ever seen or at least a significantly bigly huge alt season Which is what we are holding for on this channel. What are the odds of that happening? Well, I think they're pretty fucking high. I'm really excited right here is why So there's two things that I think are setting up for the perfect setup for this one Institutions big money governments are buying aetherium like crazy right now And there's all sorts of weird stuff happening with the price now I'm not gonna be the typical person saying it's Manipulated to the downside, but it really appears like this is happening and what we're seeing with aetherium It's the same exact bullshit. We saw with Bitcoin all of last year. You can see we got that initial pump right here This is when the ETF and everything started to go live around this and it did nothing For almost eight months and people were like, oh, obviously the market's done the ETF failed No wings and yet no way this goes any higher and then it exploded because what they were doing is they were suppressing the price The entire time they are buying tons and tons of it and eventually they ran out of Bitcoin and they couldn't suppress the price Anymore and it skyrocketed. We're seeing the same exact thing happening with aetherium Okay We saw the proposal of the ETF and everything go live and then what we've seen Really the past year is a very flat kind of range for aetherium very similar to Bitcoin now I know this looks very rangy and crazy right here But if we go back and look at Bitcoin, I just want to give you guys context here to how you look at these things So if we look at Bitcoin during 2024, we have these big crazy ranges too. There's so many times where the thing went up whatever 20,000 $40,000 and then dipped another bit and did all these crazy little moves right here And if you had sold at any time from that you just would have been an idiot now There's a few things that have made aetherium a little bit more volatile than Bitcoin was at this time Primarily the crazy salon of meme coin season the one thing that really caught me off guard And I did not see happening was meme coins being as big as they were I did not think that it would suck up and make such a black hole That it would suck all the liquidity out of the entire market and put a pause on Aetherium and basically all utility coins whatsoever, which are mostly on the theorem blockchain the reason why this has been so volatile is because faith in a theorem has just gone bad and Everybody put all their money in Solana and now everybody that's retail or smaller Investors have lost all their money in meme coins in Solana. And so now they're double taking their money on the market And that's why we're seeing some volatility right here on eat There's a little bit higher than what Bitcoin was doing consensus is still the same Institutions are buying tons of ether tons and tons and tons of it funny enough They're also buying tons of Solana right now While everybody is panic selling it the Solana ETFs and all that same exact scenario is going on with those I think we're gonna see the same bull price suppressing that we're seeing in a theorem right now on Solana We're gonna see it the same exact thing probably happened with Cardano as well as ETFs are being discussed there as well But back to the point at hand People are Absolutely burn on Solana and meme now. I'm still pretty bullish on Solana I don't think it's gonna outperform or greatly outperform a theorem from this point for a while I think Solana is probably going to 500 600 all the crazy numbers But I don't think we're gonna get there easily at this point until it kind of resets It's done phenomenal moves already But I think we were almost exclusively seeing a Solana and meme coin bull market and the rest of the market really hasn't even moved that Much yet. So what this has set us up for is Utility season people are not going to be buying meme coins and Solana like they were anytime soon I think right now this is crazy, but it's probably the right time to be buying meme coins. They're down 95 90% I don't think meme coins are ever going anywhere I think gambling and crypto and this type of mentality that we saw meme coins is going to be permanent I don't care what regulation comes. I don't care what happens crypto still decentralized There is always going to be an appetite for this crazy type of pumped up fun gambling I don't think it's going anywhere and I think the good meme coins are easily going to put in huge legs here in the future now I Suck at meme coins. I tried like four or five meme coins the last few months didn't do well on any of them It's not my forte and I didn't go super heavy on them But it was enough it dabbling with them to just realize this is where I want to be at It's not something I want to be suggesting on this channel except for my meme coin Which is going to be the most fair PvP meme coin drop of all time. Follow me on Twitter for more information I'm making zero dollars for it It's gonna be the funniest thing you ever seen that said with a theorem right now and where the markets at People are hungry to invest in things that have a story and a narrative behind them That's going to keep the price somewhat afloat if you look at utility coins right now They're only down like 60 70 percent which seems astronomical in terms of normal investing but for utility and all points That's really not much. They're not down the 98% that meme coins are and people still want to gamble here People still want to play and we have all the institutions coming in and investing all these coins Which is going to trigger that type of utility all season we're looking for I can't picture a better scenario where people or large money is buying all these coins and then people are also Simultaneously to smaller investors are sick of the high-risk gambling coins for the moment Which is again going to go and trigger this alt season. I'm seeing right here This is where I'm getting these crazy 20 10 30 X gains that I'm throwing out to you in this video now again We looking at extremely good coins and RWA, which is probably gonna be I think the hottest narrative I think AI is gonna run very hard I think RDA is gonna be going to run turbo hard and I think gaming is really gonna have its place a little bit later This year, but we're looking at one of the best RWA games or RWA coins like pin link and it's significantly down But from these levels right here We can easily see like without even a shot without pin link go to a 600 million dollar market Like that's not even hard if we get an RWA bull run So we're looking at this an easy 10x entry right here on a big chunky quality coin heck if we just go and look at some of the largest coins out here Cardano if we get a bull run is Going to four or five dollars. I don't even like Cardano. I hate all all you cardinal holders watching this video I'm still gonna make fun of you for living under your staircase like Harry Potter Well, some dude bangs your wife on the top floor of your house It eats all your ham and gives you 30 minutes of access to Wi-Fi per day but the coin right here if we get a bull run and L1s is obviously gonna go back to three four dollars or at least it's old all-time high We have avax at twenty one dollars. We got suey one of the most hyped up coins. We get hype You got tau you got arm you got on do you got all these coins and some of the best? Industries that are really high quality coins and you can hold for years without taking on super risk and by that There's no such thing as no risk in crypto all these coins have a chance to go down another 80% again I told you my view here is 50-50 But the bet returns are lopsided if I go and buy and for all of you to have an IQ over 10 I'm sorry. I have to repeat myself here But people that watch this I have to sugarcoat and re-emphasize these basic understandings over and over again because people will not Listen, and then they act shocked when all the things that I talk about and re-emphasize over and over again So, please bear with me I know I have to repeat myself sometimes but if I go and buy tau right here Let's look at my odds tower here could easily go to a 10 15 million dollar market cap. No problem easy 5-6 X from here Now I think that is almost guaranteed to happen if we see an AI crypto bull run and AI crypto is adopted in the mainstream Which I think is inevitable. So even if I'm wrong about this right now, yeah We'll probably see bit tensor go down to 150 dollars way to 50% loss That's fine because on the other side of this bet there was an easy 5 to 6 X that is lopsided returns That's why I'm taking the bet. I'm not taking the bet because I'm sure so you have to understand We're looking at this and roulette table odds We're not looking at this with certainty or trying to get some guaranteed lower sister entry There is always massive risk this we still have a substantial chance to lose money here We just have a much higher return if we're right, so please keep that in mind when I talk about these coins But we're getting amazing entries on coins like this Coins like on dough big chunky AI coins like a Oz that you would normally not be able to get you normally what you would have To do to make money in crypto like you've had to do last few months is hop in a really high risky pumping hyped up coins now you can make a ton of money doing that but you can also lose a ton of money really fast and if You're a beginner here or you're in your first year or you're very good at this, which is 95% of you You don't understand how retarded you are One of the the biggest skill sets in crypto is realizing you're retard and you're just better off holding and trying your bestest to buy When everybody's all bloody and angry like they are right now, but you don't have to take those giant crazy hyped up bets anymore You literally have access to really good coins and you can just be chunky as by Cardano by a backs by suey by hype By a Oz by Tao by on dough by super and beam and just have exposure to all these industries and just sit back and do Nothing and that is one of the ways we made a ton of money in 2023 holding till now and we're still substantially up on all those bets and we're still holding them because it's easy and you don't get many shots at entries like that, so With the narrative I saw shaping up and I just laid out to you early on in this video That's why I'm still very bullish right now, and I'm still holding on these coins So what coins in particular am I very bullish on if you go back to my last few videos? You look at my RWA video you look at my AI video you look at my gaming videos I'm still very bullish on all those coins The way I see this playing out is AI and RWA coins Those are the most common-sense narratives that normal investors are going to ape Into after we start seeing the moves on the top coins and all the institutions and everything start flooding in So following that I think gaming is going to have its big run probably later this year I know a lot of people watching this channel are super interested in gaming coins. What's my opinion on those? I think that I think what we saw with streamers and Influencers all pumping meme coins that turned out really bad for them If you couldn't tell anybody they've went and started pumping meme coins specifically from their twitch channels or to mainstream audiences eat them alive Okay, so for example we saw like Aiden Ross talking about MLG literally at the top and it took like a 90% dip I'm not here to talk about MLG or say it's a good or a bad coin I'm saying that just really didn't work out well for him in this audience if you look at people like that He's going to be launching a GTA server where he puts his own crypto coin on it And I think what a lot of twitch streamers and gaming influencers Which is absolutely Giants are going to be doing is they're gonna realize that they can pump gaming coins and make a ton of money and not get Slapped on the wrist because they actually get demand and use if they go and play a game That's really popular that has like fortnight level attention, which is going to come in crypto gaming They can go and say oh get this coin get this coin and they can get huge chunks of the coin from the sponsorship They can do all sorts of crazy little Shilly scuzzy things and not get slapped in the wrist like they did with meme coins They're gonna do the same thing with meme coins, but in gaming coins and they're gonna get away with it this time That's what I'm saying. So I'm still super bullish on game coins, but I think that happens later this year I think AI and RWA is Absolutely where the money is going to flow out But the first thing we're probably gonna see is we're gonna see a theorem probably start to lead the market I think we'll see Bitcoin kind of recover from here I think we'll see the effect of all this institutions buying a theorem and us running out of theorem happening And if you notice finance and all these other businesses, they're dumping all at the same time as all this fear and everything is happening Why are they doing do you think they think this is the right time to sell or this is about no They're manipulating the fucking prices for big money players. You're literally looking at that happening right now Solana that said when these things start to run especially a theorem we're gonna see Cardano. We're probably gonna see chain link We're gonna see a Vax. We're gonna see suey. We're gonna see hype We're see all these big chunky coins in the top 50 do really well I think particularly bit tensor and ondo probably internet computer poly market, which has a lot of real-world application right now I think arboretum. I think all these big chunky boring infrastructure coins are gonna do really well easy three five X's from here I even think Solana is probably gonna be a really good buy from everybody's pricing in the unlocks and everything and thinking they're gonna beat All the VC investors right here I don't think that's how it's gonna play out a lot of these VCS and people that had Their pre-seed deals in Solana You can still sell that shit like you can still sell that the people that want to hold and they probably Exited for lower than the current price. For example salon. It was at $250 You can go to somebody and say hey I'll give you my pre-sale deed or writes for $150 and that's what big BC's are going to fucking do if they want the money ASAP, so I don't think we're gonna see some big giant dump after the unlock I think we're seeing the big giant dump right now in Solana now after that happens I think real-world asset coins are going to be the hottest narrative. Why cuz it's super boring This is converting basically everything we do we see in traditional finance investing over to blockchain now blackrock every big institution They're talking about this. They're hyping up and I think they're gonna start investing here very very heavily What does that mean all these RWA coins that we've talked about on the channel are there? We've mentioned the past are just gonna go nuts from here Now I'm gonna make a future RWA and AI video next week or later on this week to kind of recap all the coins I don't want to recap every single coin in this video. I'm very bullish on pin link I'm very bullish on on dough. I'm very bullish on chain link. It's need to do all the interactions for singer There's a bunch of other coins. I'll talk about in later videos. I don't want to make this like a hot pick video I just want to make this like you can buy big chunky boring ass coins and be extremely successful right now video That's what I'm trying to get across right here We don't have to go down and scroll down to the five million dollar market cap point to try and find something other people have Not by yet. Literally. Everybody is so turned off and angry at crypto You can buy phenomenal coins at dumpster prices And this is where some of the easiest money in crypto is made also extremely bullish on crypto autos I think that's gonna do very well as I mentioned you don't have to go down to the five million dollar market cap I think that coins gonna do stupid. Well, and I think that market cap is goofy Then on top of that with the video and I've talked about why AI is so bullish in crypto and why it goes together with It like peanut butter and jelly watch my AI videos. I think it's gonna do phenomenal from here You could just be a stupid retard and buy bit tensor near an internet computer and call it a day Maybe some render too and be done, but you guys know I love AI coins I bullish on all things from a OS Destra all the way down to neural AI and PI and we'll talk about those later in AI video we don't need to do that because we have so many videos on this channel about AI already my opinions on have not Changed and we are still at the core Belief the core bets that want to re-emphasize before I wrap up this video That we need to hold till an aetherium all-time high if we don't see an aetherium all-time high and that was the top of The cycle I have news for you. We're fucked and part of taking bets in crypto is Understanding the bet you're taking that's the bet we're taking if we don't see any aetherium all-time high We're not gonna make money here. We're gonna lose our money probably go back to our entries in 2023 even and we're gonna have to hold and a lot of these mid caps and lower kept points are not gonna come back That is the bet that is the risk We're taking in return for the giant gains that are on the table and you just have to be okay with that and you have To let the roulette wheel spin out and the thesis is we are going to see huge Volatility and going to have to hold to this volatility like you always do in crypto until we see an aetherium all-time high or above That and that's simply how the cookie crumbles based on that thesis based on everything. I'm saying I think it's extremely stupid to be selling before we even get a wisp of a $4,000 aetherium I think that is right on the table Institutions clearly think it's on the table of how much you're buying and the current climate where people are sick of meme coins for the Time being again, I don't think they're permanently don't mean coins I think meme coins are here forever. But right now people are really mad at meme coins So they're going to be looking to make money somewhere else. I can't picture a better situation to predict an aetherium all-time high I can't see it. I don't see it the president countries institution Everyone's buying a theorem right now Well all sorts of funky manipulative stuff is happening on the price the same thing was off Bitcoin and everybody's tired of memes I can't sit here and come up with a better story for an aetherium all-time high which is what our thesis is all based Around so that's what I'm thinking guys. That's why I'm still really bullish I know people are gonna be very angry at me for this video They're gonna be cussing that's a banker's bullish and people are just being Ridiculous right now because this is did you think we were getting to all-time highs without volatility? This is the default state for all coins in mid caps and crypto and the one thing that made it really funky or a little Bit off was this meme coin craze that we saw which is now over So it's like look you were crazy bullish when we're seeing Trump put in 14 million dollar candles and now that we're down 80% and people were done with meme coins and we're seeing the same price action and institutions being wildly bullish on a theorem or you're being like Nope, not gonna buy totally time to stay on the market and sell all my coins at huge losses Like I don't understand that and it's frustrating to see because I frankly always kind of felt like everything We're seeing we're in the market right now and these type of experiences we're having right now These were the default expectations now people suddenly think that if you see volatility in coins, it means the markets over I don't get it. That's my thoughts. If you want my thoughts sooner you want to see coins I'm looking at information on my meme coin is going to be fantastic the biggest in history follow me on Twitter at CSS Becker I don't have anything else to add Hello
